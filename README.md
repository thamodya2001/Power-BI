🔷 Sales Analysis Power BI Dashboard – Description
This is my very first Power BI dashboard as a beginner. I created it to explore and understand sales data more effectively. The dashboard provides a simple yet insightful overview of sales performance across different dimensions.

It includes:

✅ Total Sales to show the overall revenue.

📦 Sales by Product to identify top-selling items.

📍 Sales by Region/Location to see where most sales come from.

📊 Monthly Sales Trend to track how sales change over time.

🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Top Customers or Salespersons contributing to total sales.

🔎 Interactive Filters for users to explore specific details.

I’m eager to polish my skills further and learn more advanced features of Power BI as I grow in data analysis.
